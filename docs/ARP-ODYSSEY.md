Signal sources: the "raw" tones or noise which will ultimately be shapoed into musical sounds

## Signal Modifiers

The raw sounds are passed through signal modifiers where the timbre ( or tone quality ) is changed to produce the desired sound

## Controllers

Devices which determine the operating characteristics of the signal sources and the signal modifiers. For instance, 
the keyboard is a controller which produces a voltage to tell the oscillator what pitch to create. Similarly, the ADSR
envelope generator creates an attack and decay signal that controls the Voltage Controlled Filter (VCF) so that the final musical sound has an attack and decay.

The body of the violin is actually a mechanical filter and corresponds to the Voltage Controlled Filter (VCF) on the Odyssey. It is the characteristic resonances of the body that give the violin its distinctive tone quality. The fingerboard, like the keyboard on your Odyssey, determines the pitch of the sound. The movement of the bow, like the ADSR Envelope Generator, determines the attack and decay of characteristics of the sound.

## Sound Sources

The Voltage Controlled Oscillator on your Odyssey produces electrical waveforms (saw-tooth, pulse, and square waves) which are used to create a wide range of sound timbres. If a signal genearated by an oscillator has the same waveform as a sound created by a traditional instrument, both will sound the same.

Different waveforms have different sounds. Your Odyssey is capable of creating six basic waveforms, plus noise.

Sawtooth wave; full, brassy
Square wave; clarinet-like
Pulse wave; bright, nasal
Modulated pulse wave; chorus-like, rich
Sine wave; pure, whistle-like

Various phase-synced waveforms, bright, rich
